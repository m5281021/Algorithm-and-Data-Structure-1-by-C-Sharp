# Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my solutions to all problems from an "Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures" course from Aizu Online Judge, completed in 2023.

**Language used: C#**

The judge system for C# does not support latest version so I implemented some necessary functions manually.

## Note
This was originally for personal learning, so explanations and comments may be limited.
